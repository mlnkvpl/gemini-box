# No daemon runs in this container. `docker`/`docker compose` here talk to
# docker-socket-proxy (see docker-compose.yml) over DOCKER_HOST, not to a raw
# mounted socket and not to a nested dockerd. The proxy holds the real
# /var/run/docker.sock and exposes only a scoped subset of the Docker API —
# see docker-compose.yml for the exact grants. Same setup as claude-box —
# both agent containers share the one host daemon through their own proxy.

# Fix: the entrypoint runs as the `node` user at runtime but this global
# install happens as root at build time — confirmed on claude-box this
# breaks the CLI's self-updater with a permissions error. Hand the install
# tree to `node` so it can update itself.
